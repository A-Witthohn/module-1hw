# Challenge 1 CODE REFACTOR


## Description

 The intent of this website is to properly demostrate the tools taught/learned in the UNC Bootcamp regarding HTML and CSS specifically. This can be seen with the use of comment tags in both the index.html file and the css.style sheet. The purpose of all changes were to make the page function as intended, consolidate code where redundancies occured, and to adjust non semantic elements to the appropriate semantic elements.
